            <p>The code for this is <a href="https://github.com/askmeaboutlo0m/rouse">in this GitHub repository</a>. The engine is called "rouse" because that's what happens if you look for synonyms of "animate".</p>

            <p>There's some keys to control this (sorry mobile users, I'll add touchy buttons some time):</p>
            <ul>
                <li><kbd>R</kbd> to reload the scene</li>
                <li><kbd>F</kbd> to toggle the fps counter</li>
                <li><kbd>W</kbd> for fullscreen mode</li>
                <li><kbd>Q</kbd> to leave fullscreen</li>
                <li><kbd>D</kbd> for the pivot point debug view</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Licenses</h2>
            <p>These licenses allow other people to make use of this stuff. Copyright law is complicated and applies automatically, so you have to say a lot of words to unapply it. If you're just <em>viewing</em> the animation, you need not pay much mind to these.</p>

            <p>tl;dr: it's all great work available to use freely, made by great people. I 
            didn't make any of them. The following reproduces all of their licenses in 
            full. If there were multiple license options to choose from, I picked one. 
            Copyright dates in the license texts may be outdated, people don't religiously 
            update them to the current year. They are how I found them.</p>
            <p>If you redistribute this thing or a modified version thereof, include these 
            licenses as well so you comply with them.</p>

AMSFonts (v. 2.2) copyright

The PostScript Type 1 implementation of the AMSFonts produced by and
previously distributed by Blue Sky Research and Y&Y, Inc. are now freely
available for general use. This has been accomplished through the
cooperation
of a consortium of scientific publishers with Blue Sky Research and Y&Y.
Members of this consortium include:

Elsevier Science IBM Corporation Society for Industrial and Applied
Mathematics (SIAM) Springer-Verlag American Mathematical Society (AMS)

In order to assure the authenticity of these fonts, copyright will be
held by
the American Mathematical Society. This is not meant to restrict in any way
the legitimate use of the fonts, such as (but not limited to) electronic
distribution of documents containing these fonts, inclusion of these fonts
into other public domain or commercial font collections or computer
applications, use of the outline data to create derivative fonts and/or
faces, etc. However, the AMS does require that the AMS copyright notice be
removed from any derivative versions of the fonts which have been altered in
any way. In addition, to ensure the fidelity of TeX documents using Computer
Modern fonts, Professor Donald Knuth, creator of the Computer Modern faces,
has requested that any alterations which yield different font metrics be
given a different name.</pre>
